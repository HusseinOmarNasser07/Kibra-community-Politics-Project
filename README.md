# Kibra-community-Politics-Project
Taj al huquq - Crown of justice is coming up with 'Community politics' a movement set to change Kibra politics ,to re-engage people with political action on a local level.  We look forward in making it the most developed movement adopted to Kibra communities, other parties, and Independents. We will give an example in reference and citing the victory of the late Ken Okoth (May his soul Rest In Peace) , his political style and  what we should take from him as a community.  The 'Community politics' is based on small-scale action on local political issues. To give an example of how it works , the do's and don'ts , the strategies to take and how to unite our community in choosing our leaders .  The result is a stronger local community , united , peaceful and  ambassadors of positive , non tribal politics.
